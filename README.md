## Description

This repository contains a hyperparameter processor to brute-force ML model training and select the best model based on the metrics.

The source data was extracted from the [Hass Avocado Board](https://hassavocadoboard.com/) website. The EDA and ETL processes have been omitted from this repository.

This repository is part of the original project carried out by [Patricia G-R Palombi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patricia-g-r-palombi-269b78183/), [JosÃ© Dos Reis - josedosr](https://github.com/josedosr), [Pamela Colman - pamve](https://github.com/pamve), and myself.
